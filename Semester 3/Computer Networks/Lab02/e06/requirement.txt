6.   The server chooses a random integer number. Each client generates a random integer number and send it to the server. 
The server answers with the message “larger” if the client has sent a smaller number than the server’s choice, 
or with message “smaller” if the client has send a larger number than the server’s choice. 
Each client continues generating a different random number (larger or smaller than the previous) according to the server’s indication. 
When a client guesses the server choice – the server sends back to the winner the message “You win – within x tries”. 
It also sends back to all other clients the message “You lost – after y retries!” (x and y are the number of tries of each respective client). 
The server closes all connections upon a win and it chooses a different random integer for the next game (set of clients).
