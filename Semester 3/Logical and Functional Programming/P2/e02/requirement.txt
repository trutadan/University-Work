2.  a. Sort a list with keeping double valuesin resulted list. E.g.: [4 2 6 2 3 4] --> [2 2 3 4 4 6]
b. For a heterogeneous list, formed from integer numbers and list of numbers, write a predicate to sort every sublist, keeping the doubles.
Eg.: [1, 2, [4, 1, 4], 3, 6, [7, 10, 1, 3, 9], 5, [1, 1, 1], 7] => [1, 2, [1, 4, 4], 3, 6, [1, 3, 7, 9, 10], 5, [1, 1, 1], 7].
