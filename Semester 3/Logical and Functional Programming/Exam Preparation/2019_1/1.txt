% 1. We define in Prolog the following predicate with
% the flow model (i, o). Explain the logical 
% error in the following sequence, and correct it:
% f([], 0).
% f([H|T], S):-
%    f(T, S1),
%    S1 is S-H.

% The logical error in the above sequence is that the predicate f
% is attempting to subtract the head H of the input list from the 
% output variable S before the value of S1 has been calculated. 
% This means that the value of S is not initialized when the 
% subtraction is attempted, resulting in a variable error.

% correction: 
f([], 0).
f([H|T], S):-
    f(T, S1),
    S is S1-H.
