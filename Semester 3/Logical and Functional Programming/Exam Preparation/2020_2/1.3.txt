; 1.3 The LISP function G is defined by 
(DEFUN G(L) (LIST (CAR L) (CAR L))) 
; In order to rename the function G we execute 
(SETQ Q 'G) 
; followed by 
(SETQ P Q)
; What is the result of evaluating the form 
(print (FUNCALL P '(A B C)))
; Jusfify the answer.

; The first SETQ statement assigns the symbol G to the variable Q. 
; The second SETQ statement assigns the value of Q (which is G) to the variable P. 

; (FUNCALL P '(A B C)) is equivalent to (G '(A B C)).
; -> the result = (list A A) = (A A)
