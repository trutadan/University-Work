% 1.4 Consider the PROLOG predicate f(list, integer) with the flow model (i, 0). 
f([], 0).
f([H|T], S):-
    f(T, S1),
    S1 is S-H.
% Give the result of the evaluation f([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], S)? Justify the answer.

% Error because arguments are not sufficiently instantiated.
% Due to the recursion of the call f(T, S1), the S1 will have the value 0, then it will be 
% assigned the value of S-H, H is known but the value of S has not been mapped yet.
