% 1. The variable L is initialized by (SET 'L '(T NIL T)). 
% In order to apply a logic disjunction between elements of L, 
% we execute (APPLY 'OR L). What is the result of evaluating 
% this form? Justify your answer and give a solution for 
% such a situation. 

The OR is a special operator, not a function, so it cannot be used with the APPLY function.
The solution of the issue:
(SET 'L '(T NIL T))
(REDUCE (LAMBDA (x y) (OR x y)) L)

Use a lambda function that mimics the result of the or operator on two arguments.
REDUCE is a function that applies a binary function to the elements of a list, from left to right. 
The lambda function applies to the first two elements of the list, then to the result and the next element, 
and so on, until it reaches the end of the list.
