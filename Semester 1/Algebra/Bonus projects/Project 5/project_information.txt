What was the approach?
All the rows possible, made up of values of 0 and 1 will be generated, based on the length entered. Then, all of these rows will be merged in order to obtain all possible binary matrices.
Then, each matrix is going to be checked. First, if it is in the row echelon form, checking the 2 well-known properties:
(1) the rows 1, . . . , r are non-zero and the rows r + 1, . . . ,m are zero;
(2) 0 ≤ N(1) < N(2) < · · · < N(r) ,
where N(i) denotes the number of zero elements from the beginning of the row i, ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , r}.
Second, we need to see if the leading entry in each row is the only non-zero entry in its column.
If the properties mentioned above are all checked, that means the matrix is in reduced row echelon form, so we print it in the output file.

How to run the program?
In the input file - "input.txt" should be present a string representing two numbers between 2 and 5, no additional spaces, newlines, or other characters. Otherwise, a suitable message will be displayed.
The python program can be run now.
In the output file - "output.txt" should now be displayed the output format mentioned in the pdf of the project, or the corresponding message if the input was not in the correct format.

Remarks:
-the input_and_output_example_x.txt files represent all the possible outputs that can be displayed by the program.
-in order to run the application, numpy and itertools python libraries should be installed on the system.
