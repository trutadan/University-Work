Consider the Bertrand paradox. For each of the three cases generate a sample of 100 elements (chords) 
and compute the ratio of the chords bigger than the side of the equilateral triangle inscribed in the circle.
The circle radius is equal with 1 and the set of chords will contain the cartesian coordinates of the edges of the chords. 
The origin of the coordinate system is in the origin of the circle.
Draw using matplotlib each set of chords for each case respectively.
