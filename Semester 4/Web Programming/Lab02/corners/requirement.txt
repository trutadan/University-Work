Write a web page which should contains 4 divs in the center of the screen. 
All divs should have the same dimensions (width and height) and they should overlap (so that a single div is visible at a specific time). 
When the mouse gets over the divs from the center of the screen, all 4 divs shoud transition to the 4 corners of the screen.
