Statement: Implement a parser algorithm (final tests)



Input: 
1) g1.txt + seq.txt


2) g2.txt + PIF.out (result of Lab 3)



Output: out1.txt, out2.txt



Run the program and generate: 
- out1.txt (result of parsing if the input was g1.txt);


- out2.txt (result of parsing if the input was g2.txt);


- messages (if conflict exists/if syntax error exists - specify location if possible)



PART 4: Deliverables


Source code for the parser + in/out files + documentation
