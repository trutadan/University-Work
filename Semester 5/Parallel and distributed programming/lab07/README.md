Goal:


The goal of this lab is to implement a distributed algorithm using MPI.



Requirement:


Perform the multiplication of 2 polynomials, by distributing computation across several nodes using MPI. 
Use both the regular O(n2) algorithm and the Karatsuba algorithm. Compare the performance with the "regular" CPU implementation from lab 5.
