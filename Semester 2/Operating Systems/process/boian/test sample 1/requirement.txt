Write a program A that receives two FIFO names as the first two command line 
arguments, and an optional string as the third command line argument. If there 
is no third argument, it reads from the first FIFO a string and writes its length 
in the second FIFO. If there is a third command line argument, it writes it in the 
first FIFO and reads its length from the second FIFO, then it displays the length 
in the console. Write a second program B, that displays the length of every command 
line argument it gets, creating two FIFOs and running two processes A.
